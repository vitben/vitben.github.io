title: "Fourier analysis of power converters ripple"
---

Current fluctuations in the Power Converters powering the magnets of CERN transfer lines can cause intabilities in the trasnported particle beam. 

* Extraced and cleaned operational data and prepared them for analysis.
* Apply Fourier analysis to identify time patterns in power converters ripple.
* Perform statistical analysis to find correlations between ripples in different converters.
* Summarized and presented reuslts in front of senior maangement.
