title: "Fourier analysis of power converters ripple"
---

Ripple in the current powering the magents used for particle transport have a considerable effect on the central position of the transported particle beam.
Being able to find any pattern or correlation among the ripple in different converters on hte same line would allow to foresee the current values and therefore compensate for the ripple using a control loop. \\
For this project, an analysis of the ripple in the power converters of the TT41 beam transport line at CERN is presented. Fourier ananlysis is used to identify the frequency componets of the ripple and to correlate them to other converters. The reuslts of the work drove a major power converters upgrade campaign.
