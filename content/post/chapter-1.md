title: "Fourier analysis of power converters ripple"
---

Current fluctuations in the Power Converters powering the magnets of CERN transfer lines can cause instabilities in the transported particle beam. 

* Extracted and cleaned operational data and prepared them for analysis.
* Apply Fourier analysis to identify time patterns in power converters ripple.
* Perform statistical analysis to find correlations between ripples in different converters.
* Summarized and presented results in front of senior management. 
* The analysis results triggered an upgrade of the power converters grid (500 kCHF)

In figure, the correlation matrix showing how the phases of the different peaks in current ripples correlate with the ones of the other converters.
