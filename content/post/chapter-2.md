title: "Baeysian optimisation of particle beam distribution"
---

In order to exploit its full potential, it is fundamental to minimize the set-up time of the particle beam needed for the AWAKE experiment at CERN. For this reason a dedicated optimizer was developed, that exploits different algorithms to optimize the particles beam profile at the entrance of the experiment. The application allow to choose between two optimizers; a Baeysian optimizer based on Gaussian Processes and a numerical one based on py-BOBYQA algorithm.
