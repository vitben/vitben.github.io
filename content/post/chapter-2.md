title: "Bayesian optimization of particle beam distribution"
---

The purpose of particle accelerators consists, most of the times, in delivering a particles beam with a given size and intensity. This can be achieved by adjusting the adjusting the strength in the magnet used to transport it. For the AWAKE experiment at CERN I developed an application that allows to optimize the beam parameters online

* Developed the code for online data acquisition and analysis.
* Used numerical and Bayesian optimization algorithms to find in minutes the desired beam parameters.
* Deployed the optimization application and integrated it in the CERN control system.
