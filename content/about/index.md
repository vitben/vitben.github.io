Data scientist with a PhD in physics and 8 yearsâ€™ experience in data analytics, statistics, and modelling. 
I leverage my quantitative skills to find smart and effective solutions to complex problems.  
Curious by nature, I like to learn new skills and to creatively integrate them with my day-to-day work.  
  
Born in Milan (Italy), where I got my Master in Nuclear engineering, 
in 2014 I moved to Geneva (Switzerland) to work at CERN, the Nuclear Organization for Nuclear Research. 
Today I work for the AWAKE experiment at CERN, which aims to demonstrate principle of proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration. 
In my role, I leverage statistical methods, numerical optimization techqniques and machine learning algortithms
with the purpose of imporving the performance of the experiment.

In my free time I like cooking, playing acoustic guitar and traveling with my wife and my beatiful daghter. I am also a trainer for the CERN boxing club, 
where I had the chance of meeting and training hundreds of boxing enthusiasts of different age, gender, cultural background, and nationality.
