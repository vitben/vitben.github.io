      <description>Current fluctuations in the Power Converters powering the magnets of CERN transfer lines can cause instabilities in the transported particle beam.
Extracted and cleaned operational data and prepared them for analysis. Apply Fourier analysis to identify time patterns in power converters ripple. Perform statistical analysis to find correlations between ripples in different converters. Summarized and presented results in front of senior management. The analysis results triggered an upgrade of the power converters grid (500 kCHF) In figure, the correlation matrix showing how the phases of the different peaks in current ripples correlate with the ones of the other converters.</description>

      <description>The purpose of particle accelerators consists, most of the times, in delivering a particles beam with a given size and intensity. This can be achieved by adjusting the adjusting the strength in the magnet used to transport it. For the AWAKE experiment at CERN I developed an application that allows to optimize the beam parameters online
Developed the code for online data acquisition and analysis. Used numerical and Bayesian optimization algorithms to find in minutes the desired beam parameters.</description>
